# My Python Notes



## About

This is the source of my notes for Python. You can see the web site generated from the notes (the Jupyter notebooks) [here](https://liao961120.github.io/pynote).


## Build the Site

The web site is built by the following steps: 

1. Convert Jupyter notebooks to markdown documents (by [nbconvert](https://github.com/jupyter/nbconvert))
1. Turn the md documents into a web site with Jekyll  
(Auto-generated by GitHub Pages in the `docs/` folder in the repo)

or more simply, just run:

```bash
bash build.sh
```

Note that in order to create yaml frontmatter (for Jekyll) in the markdown documents generated from the Jupyter notebooks, each Jupyter notebook begins with a raw block with yaml frontmatter written in it:

```yaml
---
layout: page
title: Overview
navigation: 1
---
```

## Theme

The theme of the web site is a minimal Jekyll documentation theme, created by [alexander-heimbuch/millidocs](https://github.com/alexander-heimbuch/millidocs). I really like this theme because of its simplicity (the flat `.md` structure).
